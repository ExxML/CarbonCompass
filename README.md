## �📖 About

Carbon Compass is an interactive web application that empowers users to reduce their environmental impact through informed transportation choices. Simply enter your origin and destination, and our app will show you multiple route options with their respective carbon footprints, helping you choose the most sustainable way to travel.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Route Planning**: Compare walking, cycling, public transit, and driving options
- **Real-Time Carbon Calculations**: See estimated CO₂ emissions for each transportation mode
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Visualize routes and make selections directly on the map
- **Weather Integration**: Get current weather information to help plan your journey
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

## 🧮 Carbon Emission Calculations

Our carbon footprint calculations are based on established emission factors for different transportation modes:

### Transportation Mode Emission Factors

| Transportation Mode        | Emission Factor (g CO₂e/km) | Notes                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Walking**                | 0                           | No direct emissions                             |
| **Cycling**                | 0                           | No direct emissions (excluding manufacturing)   |
| **Public Transit**         | 80                          | Average bus/train occupancy considered          |
| **Driving (Gasoline Car)** | 192                         | Based on average fuel consumption of 8.0L/100km |
| **Electric Vehicle**       | 55                          | Based on average grid emission intensity        |

### Calculation Method

For each route, we calculate emissions using:

```
Total Emissions (g CO₂e) = Distance (km) × Emission Factor (g CO₂e/km)
```

_Note: These estimates are for educational purposes and may vary based on actual vehicle efficiency, occupancy rates, and regional energy sources._

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js** with **Vite** - Modern React development environment
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Google Maps JavaScript API** - Interactive maps and route visualization
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API communication

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime and web framework
- **Google Maps Directions API** - Route calculation and distance data
- **Weather API Integration** - Real-time weather information
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing support

## 📋 Technical Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v20 or higher
- **npm** v9 or higher
- **Google Cloud Platform account** with the following APIs enabled:
  - Google Maps JavaScript API
  - Google Maps Directions API
  - Google Maps Places API

### Required API Keys

You'll need to obtain API keys from Google Cloud Platform:

- **Client-side API key** for the frontend (browser-restricted)
- **Server-side API key** for the backend (server-restricted)

## � Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies for both client and server:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd StormHacks-2025

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env` files in both directories:

**Server `.env` file** (`server/.env`):

```env
MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

**Client `.env` file** (`client/.env`):

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Running the Application

You need to run both the server and client in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Start the Backend Server:**

```bash
cd server
npm start
# For development with auto-reload:
# npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Start the Frontend Client:**

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (or the URL shown in your terminal)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/api/health

## 🎯 Usage

Once both servers are running:

1. **Open the application** in your browser (typically http://localhost:5173)
2. **Enter your starting location** in the "From" field
3. **Enter your destination** in the "To" field
4. **View route options** with carbon emission calculations for each transportation mode
5. **Compare environmental impact** and choose the most sustainable option

## � API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/directions` - Get route directions and carbon calculations
- `GET /api/weather` - Get weather information for locations
